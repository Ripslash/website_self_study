	<section> 
		Heya! My name is Tyler Roache, and I'm a recent grad from UC San Diego. I've got a BS in Mathematics-Computer Science, I'm an aspiring game dev, 
			and I'm super excited to break into the tech industry. 
		I'm unexperienced professionally, unfortunately, but I'm attempting to compensate for that with enthusiasm and gumption.

		<br>

		I've taken classes on Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, Computer Graphics and Software System Design and Implementation. 
		I've created projects in an Agile environment, implemented design patterns, and worked in multidisciplinary teams for personal and academic projects. 

		<br>

		I never had any formal education in web design or development, and this entire website is all self taught! I've been teaching myself HTML, CSS, and SQL in my free time, trying to 
		become a jack of all trades, per say. 

		<br>
		
		I'm comfortable in a leadership role and am skilled at breaking complex problems down into manageable pieces, and I just love turning a complex problem into a beautiful solution. 

		<br>
		<br>

		I love the outdoors in most capacities, and I like to spend a lot of my time exploring. I'm an avid climber, hiker, and skiier, and I love to share that with as many people as I can. <br>

		One of my biggest accomplishments was alpining up Mt. Rainier in Washington State with my late dad, an absolutely spectacular experience. <br>
		
		I've also canyoneered in Zion, offroaded the Poison Spider, Golden Spike and Gold Bar offroad trail, and skiied down Corbet's Couloir.<br>

		When I'm not doing that, I'm usually hanging out with friends or playing some of my favorite games. I'm a D&amp;D lover, a board game fan, and a Magic the Gathering beginner, but I enjoy them all! <br>

		Recently I've been infatuated with Arc Raiders, truly taken over my brain.

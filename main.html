	Things I want to research!
	
	Sending me an email near the bottom? That goes crazy

	Mini asides that I can scroll on, either vertically or horizontally could be super sick
	
	Gifs!! really want Gifs

	Link to my LinkedIn might be good?
	
	Link to my resume would also be smart I think


	Layout:
	
	This is going to be the main page, with some good projects (and gifs), a wee bit of personal info and 
	some contact info

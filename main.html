	Things I want to research!
	
	Mini asides that I can scroll on, either vertically or horizontally could be super sick
	
	Gifs!! really want Gifs

	Link to my LinkedIn might be good?

	This is going to be the main page, with some good projects (and gifs), a wee bit of personal info and 
	some contact info

<!--

	Things I want to research!
	
	Sending me an email near the bottom? That goes crazy

	Changing what I have to a single page maybe! Could make it more readable, 3 second positive thoughts

	Mini asides that I can scroll on, either vertically or horizontally could be super sick
	
	Gifs!! really want Gifs

	Link to my LinkedIn might be good?
	
	Link to my resume would also be smart I think

	Maybe removing the index page? swapping it to the aboutme page??

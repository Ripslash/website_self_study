		<h2> CSE 125's TBD Studios Presents: Wrong Cave! </h2>
		
		<h4> An asymmetric, 3D multiplayer game made using WebGL to display in browser </h4>
		
		<p> Here I can talk about the project itself, and what it actually looked like. <br>
		
			<img src = " example.jpg" alt = " this is the example text ">
			<code> 
				//c code <br>
				int number = 12;
			</code> 
		</p>
		
		<p> Here I can talk about the class, the group, the project, and all that. <br>
		
			How the class worked?
		
			My role in the group, how we came to decisions, how meetings went, how we assigned work, et cetera
		
		</p>
		
		
		<p> Here I can talk about the tech we used (Node.js, cannon-es, WebGL, et cetera)
		
			We wanted a physics based system to mess with because we thought it would be fun, so we debated on creating a physics engine and then quickly decided against it.
			We used Node.js for assistance in the actual networking, alongside websockets.
			We actually displayed everything using WebGL

		<h2> Graphics class back in the day?? ancient memories?? </h2>
		<h4> waow this is old, I even forgot I took the dingle dangle class! </h4>
		
		<p> 
			
			Some good screenshots of my old work would be awesome. I should try to open that stuff up again.

		<h2> Animation and Cloth Simulation project </h2>
		<h4> CSE 169: A class about 3D animation, animation, and some physics simulations. </h4>
	
		<p> Here I can talk about the skeletons and the smooth skin system.
		
			Talk about getting it all set up in OpenGL and all that jazz.

		</p>
		
		<p> Here I can talk about the actual animation system, and some of the different keyframe systems that we talked about <br>
		
			
			Great place for a wee code snippet perchance <br>
			<code> 
				code coed coedeoc oed
			</code>
		
		
			Also great for some pictures and gifs! Please get some gifs of the wasp moving, it was really cool to see

		<h2> A Simple Scheduling Android App, Done Professionally </h2>
		<h4> A simple app, but done with a Model View Presenter Pattern in an Agile environment. </h4>
		
		<p> 
			Here I can talk about the class structure and the MVP pattern that we learned <br>
			
			This will take a lot of re-research into the things that I've kinda blocked outta my head, so it might take a bit to get up n runnin.
			But that's ok! Can easily skip the section if it's making my brain combust too bad. 
		
		</p>
		
		<p> 
			Here I can talk about the Agile environment <br>
			
			If needed? This section might be super small actually

		<h2> This Website! </h2>
		<h4> A Fully Self Taught excursion into web development, frontend and backend </h4>
		
		<p> 
			<h4> Front End </h4>
			I'll probably just write about my processes! Wasn't taught any HTML and CSS, so I taught myself and created this website. <br>
		
		
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
			<h4> Back End </h4>
			I started out using a simple page hosted by Github Pages, with no real backend, then changed to a Django backend with a small database <br>
			
			Damn that sounds sick. Am I really doing this? That's so cool of me.
